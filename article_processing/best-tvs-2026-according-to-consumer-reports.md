If you want the “just tell me what to buy” version of TV shopping, Consumer Reports is still one of the best shortcuts. They buy TVs, test them in a controlled lab, and score them based on real measurements—not marketing claims.

Consumer Reports’ latest “Best TVs” list (updated **January 1, 2026**) leans heavily OLED at the top, and for good reason: **OLED is still the easiest way to make modern 4K/HDR content look expensive.** It’s not about “more pixels” or “more nits.” It’s about how the image *behaves* in real scenes—shadow detail, specular highlights, and contrast transitions that don’t look like a computer backlight trying to catch up.

With OLED, every pixel is its own light source. That means truly deep blacks without the gray haze you see on many LED/LCD TVs, and it means bright highlights (a lamp, a reflection, a star field) can pop without the rest of the screen lifting into a washed-out mess. When you watch movies at night, OLED’s contrast makes the whole image feel more three-dimensional and less “TV-ish.” It’s the difference between “that’s a nice picture” and “wait… this looks like a window.”

But OLED isn’t automatically the best choice for every room. If you have big windows, daytime sports, or a TV that’s basically always on in bright ambient light, a strong Mini-LED / high-end LCD can look *better* in practice. That’s why CR’s list includes at least one top-tier non-OLED model that’s built to fight glare and stay punchy in daylight.

Below is a CR Watchdog-style guide to the best TVs CR is recommending right now, what each one is best for, and how to pick the right tech without overpaying.

## The fast answer

If you want a safe pick and don’t want to overthink it:

- **Best all-around OLED value:** [LG OLED65C4PUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+OLED65C4PUA)
- **Best Samsung OLED value:** [Samsung QN65S90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S90F)
- **Best “money-no-object” OLED:** [Samsung QN65S95F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S95F) or [LG OLED65G5WUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+OLED65G5WUA)
- **Best non-OLED for bright rooms:** [Samsung QN65QN90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65QN90F)
- **Best 65-inch value under about $1,000:** [Samsung QN65S84FA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S84FA) (if you can get it at the right price)

Now let’s slow down and match the TV to your room and your habits.

## Best TVs overall from Consumer Reports’ tests

These are the top-tier sets highlighted by CR—strong overall picture quality, excellent HDR performance, and solid sound for a flat panel. Most people will be thrilled with any of them, but each has a “best for” scenario.

### Samsung QN65S90F
The [Samsung QN65S90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S90F) shows up as one of the smartest “top shelf without going insane” OLED buys. It delivers the kind of contrast and HDR punch that makes premium content look premium, with a feature set that’s especially attractive for gamers.

This model is a great reminder of what OLED does well: dark scenes stay dark, and bright highlights don’t smear or bloom into the surrounding image. If you watch a lot of moody shows—crime dramas, sci‑fi, prestige TV with dim lighting—OLED simply makes it easier to see what the director intended without cranking brightness and wrecking black levels.

Gaming is a strength here too: high refresh rate support (up to 4K/144Hz), variable refresh rate, and low-latency behavior. The main “ecosystem” note is Samsung’s HDR approach: Samsung supports HDR10+ but **not Dolby Vision**.

**Buy it if:** you want elite OLED picture quality and you game on a modern console or PC.  
**Think twice if:** Dolby Vision is a must-have for your streaming setup.

### LG OLED65C4PUA
If you want the cleanest “default recommendation” in this whole list, it’s the [LG OLED65C4PUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+OLED65C4PUA). LG’s C-series is the long-running sweet spot: a premium OLED panel with the features most people actually use, without forcing you into the “gallery” price tier.

OLED’s advantage shows up in the moments you can’t fake: a candle-lit room, a night skyline, space scenes, a dim hallway in a thriller. LED/LCD TVs can get bright, but they still rely on zones of backlight. When a bright object appears on a dark background, those zones can “glow” around it. OLED avoids that because it’s pixel-level light control. The result is cleaner edges, deeper blacks, and HDR that feels less like a demo and more like real depth.

LG also supports **Dolby Vision**, which matters if your viewing is mostly Netflix/Disney+/Apple TV content.

**Buy it if:** you want a reliable, premium OLED with broad HDR compatibility.  
**Think twice if:** you’re trying to max brightness in a sun-drenched room all day (OLED is great, but room conditions still matter).

### Samsung QN65S95F
The [Samsung QN65S95F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S95F) is Samsung’s “best of the best” OLED lane—more performance headroom, more HDR impact, and a more premium overall feel.

Here’s who notices the difference: people who watch a lot of HDR movies and want highlights to look *electric* without sacrificing dark-scene detail. Flagship OLEDs tend to improve the parts of OLED that used to be its compromise—peak brightness and highlight intensity—while keeping the black-level advantages that make OLED special.

**Buy it if:** you want the best Samsung OLED experience and don’t mind the price.  
**Think twice if:** you’d rather put the extra money into a great soundbar and still get an excellent TV.

### LG OLED65G5WUA
LG’s G-series is the flagship lane, and the [LG OLED65G5WUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+OLED65G5WUA) is for shoppers who want a “statement” OLED with top-tier picture performance and a premium build.

This is the kind of set that rewards good content. When you feed it high-bitrate streaming, a quality Blu‑ray, or modern console HDR, you get an image that looks composed: bright where it should be, dark where it should be, and textured in the mid-tones instead of flattening into mush. If you’ve ever noticed that some TVs make faces look slightly plastic in dim scenes, that’s often the TV fighting its own backlight and processing. OLED tends to look more natural, especially when you dial in sensible picture settings.

**Buy it if:** you want a flagship OLED and you care about HDR impact.  
**Think twice if:** you’re not going to notice (or care about) the difference between “excellent” and “best-in-class.”

### Samsung QN65QN90F (bright-room alternative)
OLED dominates dark-room movie performance, but in bright rooms, a premium Mini‑LED can be the smarter play. The [Samsung QN65QN90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65QN90F) is the “don’t ignore this” model on CR’s top list.

If your TV sits opposite windows, or you watch a lot of daytime sports, the practical goal is: stay bright, keep reflections under control, and keep the image punchy even with sunlight. This is where a strong LCD can shine (sometimes literally). You’re trading perfect blacks for more brute-force brightness and often better daytime visibility.

**Buy it if:** your room is bright and you want an HDR-friendly TV that can fight glare.  
**Think twice if:** you mostly watch at night and want perfect blacks (OLED still wins there).

## “Still great” holdovers (if priced right)

Consumer Reports also includes high-performing models from prior years that remain excellent buys *if* you can find them discounted:

- [Samsung QN65S90D ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S90D)
- [Samsung QN65S95D ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S95D)
- [Sony XR-65A95L ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+XR-65A95L)
- [Sony K65XR80M2 ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+K65XR80M2)

**Watchdog rule:** don’t overpay for an older flagship just because it used to be “the best.” Older models are only smart when the discount is real.

## Best 65-inch TVs under about $1,000 from Consumer Reports’ tests

CR’s list doesn’t pretend everyone should spend $2,500 on a TV. These are models highlighted as strong performers at lower prices, with very good overall picture quality and credible HDR performance for the money.

### Samsung QN65S84FA (value OLED to watch)
The [Samsung QN65S84FA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S84FA) is the value surprise. If you can actually buy it around the $900 range, it’s one of the easiest “quality-per-dollar” picks on this entire page.

**Watchdog tip:** on retailer-specific models like this, pricing can swing wildly. It’s a great deal at a great price—and a mediocre deal if it drifts too close to higher-tier OLEDs.

### Samsung QN65Q80DD (strong everyday value)
The [Samsung QN65Q80DD ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65Q80DD) is the kind of TV that tends to do well for bright rooms and everyday viewing—strong color, solid HDR “pop,” and generally better performance than the bargain-basement tier.

### LG 65QNED90TUA / LG 65QNED92AUA (Mini‑LED-ish value picks)
If you want brightness and big-screen impact without paying OLED pricing, LG’s QNED lane is worth a look:
- [LG 65QNED90TUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+65QNED90TUA)
- [LG 65QNED92AUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+65QNED92AUA)

These are sensible choices for living rooms with lots of ambient light, where “punch” matters more than absolute black-level perfection.

### Sony XR-65X90L (balanced motion and processing)
The [Sony XR-65X90L ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+XR-65X90L) sticks around because it’s consistently good at the things people notice day-to-day—especially motion handling and overall picture balance. If you watch sports, cable TV, or a lot of mixed content, Sony’s processing can be a real advantage.

### Hisense 65U75QG (aggressive value)
Hisense keeps showing up as a serious value brand, and CR’s list reflects that. The [Hisense 65U75QG ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Hisense+65U75QG) is a good “features per dollar” candidate if you want a modern TV experience without flagship pricing.

### Roku 65R8B5 (simple smart TV experience)
The [Roku 65R8B5 ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Roku+65R8B5) is appealing if you want the simplest smart-TV experience—fast interface, straightforward apps, minimal drama. Picture quality tends to be more “good for the price” than “wow,” but simplicity matters for a lot of households.

### TCL 65QM7K (big-screen value play)
TCL is a perennial “big screen for the money” brand, and the [TCL 65QM7K ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=TCL+65QM7K) fits that mold: a large 65-inch TV with credible HDR performance for shoppers who want value without dropping into the ultra-budget tier.

## OLED vs LCD and what actually matters (in plain English)

### OLED: why it still wins for movie lovers
OLED’s advantage isn’t theoretical. It shows up in your normal viewing:
- **Black levels:** blacks are black, not charcoal gray
- **Contrast:** bright highlights pop without lifting the whole image
- **Dark-scene detail:** shadowy scenes look cleaner and more readable
- **No obvious “halo” bloom:** bright objects on dark backgrounds stay crisp

If you watch at night, love movies, or want your TV to feel like the *best screen in your house*, OLED is usually the easiest “yes.”

### LCD / Mini‑LED: why it can be the smarter real-world choice
A strong LED/LCD TV can be better for:
- **Bright rooms**
- **Daytime sports**
- **Glare-heavy layouts**
- **Very large sizes on a budget**

The best approach is to be honest about your room. OLED is incredible, but if sunlight is blasting your screen all afternoon, your “perfect blacks” don’t matter much.

## Watchdog buying rules

1. **Pick your room first, then pick your TV.** Bright room? Favor a strong LCD/Mini‑LED like the [Samsung QN65QN90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65QN90F). Dark room and movies? OLED is the safe move.
2. **Don’t pay extra for a feature you won’t use.** If you’re not gaming, don’t chase 144Hz specs.
3. **Decide your HDR ecosystem.** Dolby Vision matters to a lot of streamers (LG supports it). Samsung doesn’t.
4. **Budget for sound.** Even “good” TV speakers are still TV speakers. If you care about dialogue, plan on a soundbar.
5. **Be skeptical of “old flagship” pricing.** Older models are only smart when the discount is real.

## Bottom line

Consumer Reports’ 2026 list makes one theme clear: **OLED still dominates “best overall,”** with LG and Samsung trading punches depending on what you value (Dolby Vision vs Samsung’s ecosystem and gaming focus). But CR also signals that a premium Mini‑LED/LCD—especially something like Samsung’s [QN65QN90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65QN90F)—can be the smartest choice in bright, real-world living rooms.

If you want the simplest “buy this and be happy” shortlist:
- [LG OLED65C4PUA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LG+OLED65C4PUA) is the clean all-around choice.
- [Samsung QN65S90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S90F) is the Samsung OLED value standout.
- [Samsung QN65QN90F ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65QN90F) is the bright-room alternative you shouldn’t ignore.
- If your budget is capped near $1,000, [Samsung QN65S84FA ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Samsung+QN65S84FA) is the value OLED to watch—assuming you can land it at the right price.
