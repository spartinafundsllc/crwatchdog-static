## Bosch Benchmark SHP9PCM5N — Best Overall

**CR Score: 85**
**Price: $1,794 – $2,384**

The Bosch Benchmark SHP9PCM5N sits at the top of Consumer Reports’ high-end rankings thanks to a rare combination of exceptional washing performance, ultra-quiet operation, and a suite of premium features. Unlike most dishwashers, this model has a **motorized wash arm** that moves independently from water pressure, allowing you to program specific quadrants for heavier cleaning—perfect for pots, pans, and baked-on messes.

The stainless steel interior, third rack, adjustable upper rack, hidden controls, and full WiFi integration make this dishwasher feel unmistakably premium. Interior lighting is the final luxury touch. Bosch also offers variants (SHV9PCM3N and SHX9PCM5N) with similar performance.

*Best for homeowners who want the highest performance and the most advanced cleaning system available.*

## Miele G7176SCVI — Best for Water & Energy Efficiency

**CR Score: 79**
**Price: $1,849**

Miele dishwashers have long been admired for their engineering, and the G7176SCVI continues that tradition. It uses just **3 gallons of water per cycle**—almost half of what many competitors consume—while still delivering excellent washing and drying scores.

The door automatically pops open after the cycle to improve drying, and Miele’s automatic detergent dispensing helps optimize cleaning. While it lacks a time-remaining display, its reliability, efficiency, and consistent performance earned it CR’s **Green Choice** designation.

*Ideal for buyers who prioritize energy efficiency without compromising performance.*

## Thermador Star Sapphire DWHD661EFP — Best Premium Features

**CR Score: 78**
**Price: $2,499**

The Star Sapphire is one of the most visually impressive dishwashers on the market. Its interior lighting includes **programmable colors**, and a projected time display on the floor makes it easy to check cycle progress at a glance.

It performs very well in both washing and drying, and its adjustable third rack allows customization for unusually shaped items. Like the Bosch, it offers app-only zone-wash controls and delayed start options.

*The best choice for homeowners designing a high-end kitchen with showpiece appliances.*

## LG Studio SDWB24S3 — Best High-End Value

**CR Score: 75**
**Price: $1,095 – $1,368**

LG’s Studio series provides a taste of luxury for far less than other premium brands. The SDWB24S3 earns strong washing and drying scores, runs quietly, and offers most of the upscale features you’d expect: interior lighting, an adjustable upper rack, a third rack, and WiFi connectivity.

Though LG’s owner satisfaction scores are only average, this model is a **CR Green Choice** and remains one of the best deals in high-end dishwashers.

## KitchenAid KDTF924PPS — Best Ease of Use

**CR Score: 77**
**Price: $1,888 – $2,099**

KitchenAid’s KDTF924PPS stands out for its exceptionally intuitive controls and outstanding upper-rack cleaning performance. It opens automatically after cycles for better drying and includes a robust feature set: a third rack, adjustable tines, plenty of flatware slots, and targeted wash options.

While KitchenAid doesn’t match Bosch or Miele in reliability, this model still performed well in every major CR test category.

*Great for users who want strong cleaning and maximum convenience.*

## How Consumer Reports Tests Dishwashers

Every dishwasher tested by Consumer Reports undergoes about 30 hours of rigorous evaluation. Engineers use photo imaging to measure cleaning performance on both racks, track energy and water use, evaluate drying on challenging items like plastics, and assess noise via listening panels.

CR also recently added an **ease-of-use** category, examining control-panel accessibility, third-rack usefulness, adjustability, and how intuitive each dishwasher is to operate.
