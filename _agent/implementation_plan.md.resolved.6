# Restore Dishwasher Article Images and Links

The recent attempt to "polish" the dishwasher article resulted in missing images and inconsistent links. This plan outlines the steps to restore the correct visual assets and monetization links while preserving the layout improvements provided in `v3`.

## Proposed Changes

### [Dishwashers Article]

#### [MODIFY] [best-high-end-dishwashers.md](file:///Users/timothybhattacharyya/Documents/crwatchdog-static/src/posts/best-high-end-dishwashers.md)
- Re-apply the `v3` source as the base to restore the correct layout and image positions.
- Swap the following placeholder/temporary image paths with the correct high-res files found in `src/markdown_images`:
    - **Bosch Benchmark**: `Benchmark Series 24 in. Stainless Steel Top Control Tall Tub Pocket Handle Dishwasher with Stainless Steel Tub, 38 dBA.jpg`
    - **LG Studio**: `LG Studio SDWB24S3 40 dBA Stainless Top Control Wi-Fi Enabled Dishwasher.jpg`
- Convert all remaining `amazon.com` URLs to the verified `geni.us` links:
    - **Bosch**: `https://geni.us/goktBN`
    - **LG**: `https://geni.us/I6Sw`

## Verification Plan

### Automated Verification
- Run a `grep` search for `amazon.com` in `best-high-end-dishwashers.md` to ensure no raw affiliate links remain.

### Browser Verification
- Open `http://localhost:8080/these-are-consumer-reports-picks-for-the-best-high-end-dishwashers/`.
- Visually confirm that:
    1. The Hero image (Bosch) loads.
    2. The Bosch section image loads.
    3. The LG section image loads.
    4. All "Check Price" buttons link to `geni.us` URLs.
    5. The layout remains standard single-column (no flexbox columnization).
