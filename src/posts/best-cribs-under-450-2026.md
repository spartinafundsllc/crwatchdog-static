## How to choose a crib (without overthinking it)

Most cribs on the market look similar, but the best ones make daily life easier. Here’s what to prioritize:

- **A firm, flat sleep surface** (pair with a well-fitting crib mattress and fitted sheet).
- **Simple mattress-height adjustment** (you’ll lower it as your baby grows).
- **Conversion options you’ll actually use.** “4-in-1” sounds great, but only matters if you plan to buy the kits and keep the crib long-term.
- **Build quality at key joints.** A crib can look perfect online and still wobble if the frame and hardware aren’t great.

## Safe sleep basics (crib edition)

Safe sleep is bigger than the crib, but your setup matters. These habits are widely recommended by pediatric safety experts:

- Place your baby **on their back** for sleep.
- Use a **crib/bassinet/play yard** with a **firm, flat mattress**.
- Use **only a fitted sheet**—no loose blankets, pillows, bumpers, stuffed toys, loungers, or positioners.
- Skip **weighted sleep sacks**.
- If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, stroller, swing, or carrier, move them to a firm, flat sleep surface as soon as you can.

If you have questions about safe sleep for your child, your **pediatrician** is the best source for personalized guidance.

## FAQ

### Do I need a conversion kit for a “convertible crib”?
Often, yes. Many cribs convert to a daybed without extra parts, but **toddler bed** and **full-size bed** setups frequently require a separate guardrail or frame kit. Check the product listing carefully.

### What does “4-in-1” or “5-in-1” actually mean?
It usually refers to the number of configurations the crib can become over time (crib → toddler bed → daybed → full-size bed, sometimes with additional variations). It’s useful **only if you plan to keep the crib for years**.

### Are wheels on a crib safe?
They can be, **if they lock securely** and you keep the crib locked during sleep. Wheels are mainly a convenience feature for moving the crib around the room.
