Buying a new vehicle is a big investment. With average prices climbing above $48,000 and inflation adding even more uncertainty, choosing a model that won’t spend lots of time in the shop is more important than ever. Consumer Reports surveys hundreds of thousands of owners each year to find out which vehicles are holding up well and which ones are causing headaches. We’ve studied the latest Consumer Reports reliability data and distilled the most useful insights to help you shop smarter.

## How Consumer Reports Measures Reliability

Each year, Consumer Reports asks its members about problems they’ve had with their vehicles in the last 12 months. The survey covers 20 trouble areas ranging from minor annoyances, like squeaky brakes or rattling trim, to costly failures of engines, transmissions and (for electrified cars) batteries and charging equipment. Scores are weighted by severity and combined into a predicted reliability score from 1–100. These scores feed into Consumer Reports’ overall vehicle ratings along with owner satisfaction, safety data and road‑test results.

Because data are collected across the 2000‑2026 model years (with a few early 2027 models), Consumer Reports can also compare brands and powertrains. The brand ranking uses the average reliability score of all tested models from 2024 to 2026, so it reflects current performance rather than a single model year.

## Subaru Takes the Lead

For many years Lexus and Toyota traded places at the top of Consumer Reports’ reliability rankings. In the latest survey, Subaru jumps ahead thanks to a lineup of dependable cars and SUVs. Models like the Forester and Impreza receive well‑above‑average ratings, while the Crosstrek, Legacy, Outback and Ascent perform at or above average. The brand’s only laggard is the Solterra electric crossover, which is closely related to the Toyota bZ4X and suffers similar early‑production issues.

Lexus and Toyota now hold the second and third spots but still score very well. Honda and its luxury division Acura round out the top five, with Acura ranking slightly ahead of Mazda because of very consistent model performance.

### Top 10 Brands by Predicted Reliability

According to Consumer Reports’ predicted reliability data, the top 3 brands are **Subaru**, **Lexus**, and **Toyota**.

<div class="table-wrapper">

| Rank | Brand | Score | Best bet to shop | Use extra caution with |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Subaru | 68 | Established models on the current platform (2+ years into the generation) | First‑year redesigns or brand‑new powertrains |
| 2 | Lexus | 65 | Mature models with long-running drivetrains | Newly redesigned models in their first model year |
| 3 | Toyota | 62 | Proven gas and hybrid lineups with multiple years of real‑world data | Brand‑new model launches and first‑year refreshes |
| 4 | Honda | 59 | Models that haven’t just been redesigned | First model year after a full redesign |
| 5 | Acura | 55 | Familiar platforms shared with high-volume Honda models | First-year versions of redesigned trims |
| 6 | Mazda | 55 | Current-generation vehicles with a few years on the road | Early production runs of new generations |
| 7 | Audi | 54 | Mature generations with known service patterns | First model year of a redesign, especially with new tech packages |
| 8 | BMW | 53 | Models with stable powertrains across multiple years | Fresh redesigns and newly introduced drivetrains |
| 9 | Kia | 51 | Models that have been on the market for several years | First-year redesigns and brand-new nameplates |
| 10 | Hyundai | 50 | Platforms that are a couple of years into production | First model year after major redesigns |

*Quick note:* these are **brand averages**—a single model (and a specific model year) can perform better or worse than the brand’s overall score.

At the opposite end of the scale, GMC, Cadillac and Rivian record the lowest reliability scores, mostly because of ongoing issues with new model launches and complex technologies.

## What These Rankings Mean for Buyers

Brand rankings are a great starting point—but they’re not the finish line. Use them like a **map**, not a guarantee.

### 1) Brand reliability is an average, not a promise
A “reliable brand” can still have a problematic model, and a “low-ranked brand” can still make a standout vehicle. Before you buy, check:
- **The specific model and model year**
- Whether it’s a **first-year redesign** or has a brand-new engine, transmission, or battery system
- How long that platform has been on the road (more history usually means fewer surprises)

### 2) SUVs and trucks are often harder on reliability than small cars
More weight, more components, and more complexity can mean more things to fail. If you want the safest bet:
- Choose a vehicle that’s been in the same generation for a few years
- Be extra cautious with **all-new pickups and large SUVs**, especially in their first model year

### 3) Hybrids are often the sweet spot for “modern + dependable”
Hybrid systems have matured, and many brands have years of data behind them. If you want better fuel economy without betting everything on brand-new tech:
- Prioritize hybrids that have been around for multiple model years
- Treat brand-new EV platforms like “Version 1.0” until they’ve had time to prove themselves

### 4) A quick “smart shopping” checklist
- Prefer **2–4-year-old platforms** (not first-year redesigns)
- Pick trims with **fewer new features** (new tech is where surprises hide)
- If you’re torn between two brands, let the **model-year track record** break the tie

## Regional and Vehicle‑Type Trends
Reliability isn’t just about individual brands—it also varies by where cars are built and the type of vehicle you choose:

- **Asian brands** lead the pack with an average score of 57. Eight of the top ten brands come from Japan or South Korea.
- **European brands** average 48, helped by strong showings from Audi and BMW.
- **U.S. brands** lag behind with an average of 38, though Buick comes in 11th overall.

When comparing body styles, cars (sedans, hatchbacks and wagons) remain the safest bet with an average reliability score of 60. Minivans follow closely at 57, while SUVs average 49. Pickup trucks are the least reliable group at 36, largely because of their complex drivetrains and heavy‑duty use.

## Hybrids Lead Among Electrified Vehicles

Consumer Reports’ data show that hybrid powertrains have matured into a dependable option. On average, hybrids have similar or slightly fewer problems than traditional gas‑only cars. Models such as the Toyota Corolla Hybrid, Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, Hyundai Elantra Hybrid and Lexus NX Hybrid earn top reliability scores. Kia’s Sorento Hybrid is the highest‑rated three‑row SUV in the survey, with the Toyota Highlander Hybrid close behind.

By contrast, plug‑in hybrids (PHEVs) and pure battery‑electric vehicles (EVs) still present reliability challenges:

- **PHEVs** have around 70 percent more reported problems than gas‑powered vehicles. The dual powertrain introduces more potential trouble spots. Some PHEVs, like the Mazda CX‑90 PHEV, score well below their conventional counterparts.
- **EVs** perform better than PHEVs but still have about 40 percent more problems than internal‑combustion cars. Owners report issues not just with electric motors and batteries but also with new infotainment systems and electronic features. The Rivian R1S, R1T and Ford F‑150 Lightning all have below‑average reliability even after several years on the market.

## Patience Pays: Avoid First‑Year Models

One consistent theme in Consumer Reports’ findings is that early adopters bear the brunt of manufacturing bugs. All‑new models often experience problems in their first two or three years before automakers work out the kinks. Recent examples include:

- **Mazda CX‑90:** Both the gas and plug‑in versions suffer transmission, steering and in‑car electronics issues.
- **Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV:** These new EVs rank among the lowest‑scoring models, with complaints ranging from battery and electrical accessories to climate control problems.
- **Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon** pickups: Owners report engine and transmission trouble along with glitchy infotainment.

On the flip side, waiting a few years pays off. The Ford Bronco Sport and Genesis GV80 both debuted in 2021 and now achieve average reliability, while the Ford Explorer, once one of Consumer Reports’ lowest‑rated SUVs, finally earns a recommendation.

## Key Takeaways for Car Shoppers

1. **Start with a reliable brand**, then drill down to specific models. Even top‑ranked companies have some underperformers, while lower‑ranked brands sometimes make a standout vehicle.
2. **Consider a hybrid** if you want efficiency without sacrificing dependability. Hybrids generally match or exceed the reliability of gas‑only cars.
3. **Be cautious with new technology.** PHEVs and EVs are improving but still exhibit more problems on average. Choose models that have been on the market for a few years, and check recent owner feedback.
4. **Don’t rush into a freshly redesigned model.** Giving automakers a couple of years to iron out early issues can save you frustration and repair costs.

By using data from Consumer Reports and approaching your purchase thoughtfully, you can pick a vehicle that will serve you reliably for years. Happy car shopping!
